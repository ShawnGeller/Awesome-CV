      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
        \item {Working under the guidance of Dr. Knill and Dr. Glancy in the Applied and Computational Mathematics Division, ITL, NIST}
        \item {Worked in collaboration with the Ion Storage group at NIST to
          characterize a measurement protocol, and to develop a new adaptive
        strategy for repeated QND measurements, to be used in fluorescence
      detection}
    \item {Worked in collaboration with the Advanced Microwave Photonics Group
      at NIST to characterize an entanglement protocol, resulting in the first
    demonstration of entanglement of two macroscopic drumheads}
  \item {Worked in collaboration with the Quantum Processing Group at NIST to
    characterize a pair of superconducting transmon qubits}
  \item {Worked with the Kaufman group at JILA to understand the potential
    computing implications of a tunnelling experiment. Also currently working
  on a proposal for a novel quantum sensing experiment.}
